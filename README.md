This are my dotfiles set up as a bare git repo and managed with [dotbare](https://github.com/kazhala/dotbare)

## Current Setup

I run Arch Linux on an Asus UX310UQK latptop; here are some of the programs I use:
- Suckless utilities (see my patched repos):   **[dmenu](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dmenu)**, **[dwm](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dwm)** (Window Manager), and **[st](https://github.com/BachoSeven/st)** (terminal emulator).
- **zsh**  shell, with some custom plugins; **[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)** with a custom lean theme; and **[fsh](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)** for syntax higlighting.
- **neovim** text editor
- **[stig](https://github.com/rndusr/stig)** to interact with the transmission-daemon client
- **ncmpcpp** as a music player (with mpd)
- **[ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)** as a tui terminal client
- **[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)** as my file manager
- **neomutt** as an email client
- **brave** browser
- **[sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv)** image viewer
- **zathura** pdf & djvu reader
- Last but not least, **[mimi](https://github.com/BachoSeven/mimi)** is an __improved xdg-open__ using bash and dmenu with a very usable config file.
