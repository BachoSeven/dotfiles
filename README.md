This are my dotfiles set up as a bare git repo and managed with [dotbare](https://github.com/kazhala/dotbare)

## Current Setup

I run Arch Linux on an Asus UX310UQK latptop; here are some of the programs I use:
- Suckless utilities (see my patched repos):   **[dmenu](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dmenu)**, **[dwm](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dwm)** (Window Manager), and **[st](https://github.com/BachoSeven/st)** (terminal emulator).
- Highly configured **zsh**  shell with  custom plugins, **[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)** with a custom lean theme and **[fsh](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)** for syntax higlighting.
- **neovim** text editor
- **[stig](https://github.com/rndusr/stig)** to interact with the transmission-daemon client
- **ncmpcpp** as a music player (with mpd)
- **[ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)** as a tui terminal client
- **[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)** as my file manager
- **neomutt** as an email client
- **brave** browser
- **[sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv)** image viewer
- **zathura** pdf & djvu reader
- **ytop** system monitoring
- Last but not least, **[mimi](https://github.com/BachoSeven/mimi)** is an __improved xdg-open__ using bash and dmenu with a very usable config file.


### Various
- I use brave as a browser, find more in `.config/brave_plugins`; a nice addition to its setup is to set duckduckgo as a new page. Then, using `gruvboxytheme` passphrase in duckduckgo settings gives you a decent start page which supports Vimium's Vomnibar.
- I also use a custome startpage with Brave, check it out [here](https://github.com/BachoSeven/startpage)
