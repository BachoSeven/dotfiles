This are my dotfiles set up as a bare git repo and managed with [dotbare](https://github.com/kazhala/dotbare)

## Current Setup

I run Arch Linux on an Asus UX310UQK latptop; here are some of the programs I use:
- Suckless utilities (links are to my patched repos):   **[dmenu](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dmenu)**, **[dwm](https://github.com/BachoSeven/dwm)** (Window Manager), and **[st](https://github.com/BachoSeven/st)** (terminal emulator).
- Highly configured **zsh**  shell with many custom plugins for completions and integrations, **[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)** with a custom lean theme and **[fsh](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)** for syntax higlighting. Despite all these customizations, my zsh has an average startup time of `0.047 s`.
- **neovim** text editor
- **[stig](https://github.com/rndusr/stig)** to interact with the transmission-daemon client
- **ncmpcpp** as a music player (with mpd)
- **[ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)** as a tui terminal client
- **[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)** as my file manager
- **neomutt** as an email client
- **brave** browser
- **[sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv)** image viewer
- **zathura** pdf & djvu reader
- **ytop** system monitoring
- **dunst** is the notification manager
- Last but not least, **[mimi](https://github.com/BachoSeven/mimi)** is an __improved xdg-open__ using bash and dmenu with a very usable config file.

## Eye-candy
- I set `gruvbox` colors in Xresources, zathura, ncspot, dircolors, dunst, neovim, all suckless configs and anywhere else I could.
- The compositor is `xcompmgr` with smooth fading, translucency and shadows
- Icons are Joypixels (`ttf-joypixels` from aur)

### Various
- I use brave browser, you can find info about my config of it at `.config/brave_plugins`. To improve its aestethics, I use a gruvbox chrome theme and duckduckgo with `gruvboxytheme` passphrase (try it!); which make a decent start page together Vimium's Vomnibar. (I now use a custome startpage with Brave, check it out [here](https://github.com/BachoSeven/startpage).)
