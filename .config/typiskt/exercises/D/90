The
unintentioned
noisiness
and
untidiness
in
the
hostess
house
astonished,
astounded
and
nauseated
Antonietta.
Undaunted
and
unassisted,
she
did
not
hesitate
to
initiate
a
statute
at
the
state
house.
The
statute
stated
that
no
attendant
in
an
untenanted
haunted
hostess
house
is
to
attain
hostess
status.
