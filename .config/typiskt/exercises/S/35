Friends,
Romans,
countrymen,
lend
me
your
ears;
Friends,
Romans,
countrymen,
lend
me
your
ears;
I
come
to
bury
Caesar,
not
to
praise
him.
The
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them;
The
good
is
oft
interred
with
their
bones;
So
let
it
be
with
Caesar:
The
noble
Brutus
Hath
told
you
Caesar
was
ambitious:
If
it
were
so,
it
was
a
grievous
fault;
And
grievously
hath
Caesar
answer'd
it.
Here,
under
leave
of
Brutus
and
the
rest,--
For
Brutus
is
an
honourable
man;
So
are
they
all,
all
honourable
men,--
Come
I
to
speak
in
Caesar's
funeral.
He
was
my
friend,
faithful
and
just
to
me;
But
Brutus
says
he
was
ambitious;
And
Brutus
is
an
honourable
man.
