Two
of
the
fairest
stars
in
all
the
heaven,
Two
of
the
fairest
stars
in
all
the
heaven,
Having
some
business,
do
entreat
her
eyes
To
twinkle
in
their
spheres
till
they
return.
What
if
her
eyes
were
there,
they
in
her
head?
The
brightness
of
her
cheek
would
shame
those
stars,
As
daylight
doth
a
lamp;
her
eyes
in
heaven
Would
through
the
airy
region
stream
so
bright
That
birds
would
sing,
and
think
it
were
not
night.--
See
how
she
leans
her
cheek
upon
her
hand!
O,
that
I
were
a
glove
upon
that
hand,
That
I
might
touch
that
cheek!
