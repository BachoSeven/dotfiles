Dear
Sirs:
Dear
Sirs:
Thank
you
for
sending
the
diskettes
so
promptly.
How-
ever,
the
diskettes
which
you
sent
are
for
soft-sectored
drives.
As
I
stated
in
my
original
letter
my
system
accepts
only
ten-sector,
hard-sectored
diskettes.
I
will
return
these
two
boxes
as
soon
as
I
receive
the
correct
ones.
Sincerely,
Mr.
Smith
